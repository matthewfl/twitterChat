TwitterChat is designed to be a chatter bot that works by looking at the tweets from users.
More specifically the replys to try and find patterns and become a chatter bot using replys.
The system uses the twitter stream api to get as many replys/tweets that is can.

To build:
	you need to get sqlite (http://sqlite.org) and libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/)
	also the system can use hoard for better memory (http://hoard.org/) if not using you need to remove from the 
libs in the makefile
	
	you might want to edit the setting in the make file
	run make
	then do:
		sqlite3 tweets.database < tweet.sql
		sqlite3 know.database < know.sql
